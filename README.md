LiveSplit Autosplitter for Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee

## Settings
### Refresh Rate
Ensure the base "REFRESH RATE OF THE AUTOSPLITTER" option is enabled, and that one (and only one) sub option is enabled. Higher refresh rate = more accurate timing, but more intensive to run.
### Good Ending / Bad Ending
If doing a full game run, enable the one (and only one) ending setting that matches your route - Good Ending if the game ends after Vykker Suites, Bad Ending if the run ends with the bad cutscene after Loading Dock
### IL Mode
If performing Individual Level runs, make sure BOTH Ending settings are disbaled and that IL mode is enables. Ensure that one (and only one) level is enabled from the sub options of IL Mode, matching the level you intend to run.
